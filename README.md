# Project: Automated Classification of Genetic Mutations for Personalized Cancer Diagnosis

## Overview
This project aims to develop an automated machine learning model that classifies genetic mutations using the Kaggle dataset provided by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The objective is to enhance the speed and accuracy of mutation classification, thereby improving the effectiveness of personalized cancer treatment.

## Problem Statement
The manual classification of genetic mutations is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project seeks to automate the mutation classification process using machine learning models, significantly reducing the time required for genetic analysis and increasing the reliability of the results.

## Requirements
•⁠  ⁠Python 3.8+
•⁠  ⁠Pandas
•⁠  ⁠NumPy
•⁠  ⁠Scikit-learn
•⁠  ⁠Matplotlib
•⁠  ⁠Seaborn

### Libraries Installation
Run the following command to install all required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


## Dataset
The dataset used is from the Kaggle competition hosted by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, which consists of an expert-annotated knowledge base of genetic mutations.

## Models Implemented
•⁠  ⁠Naïve Bayes
•⁠  ⁠Logistic Regression
•⁠  ⁠K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
•⁠  ⁠Support Vector Machine (SVM)
•⁠  ⁠Random Forest
•⁠  ⁠Ensemble Methods (Stacking, Voting)



## Results
Model performance is evaluated based on confusion matrix and log loss metrics.

## Future Enhancements
Future updates may include the integration of deep learning models and advanced NLP techniques to further enhance the classification accuracy and the development of a real-time prediction system for clinical use.
